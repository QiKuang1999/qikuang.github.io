**Qi KUANG** is an applied economist and data scientist whose work lies at the intersection of **education policy**, **development economics**, and **applied econometrics**. Her research focuses on inequality, social mobility, and resilience to climate and institutional shocks. She uses a combination of administrative data, household surveys, and geospatial information to study the impact of public policies and external shocks on individual and institutional outcomes.

Currently, she is a **data scientist at the OECD Directorate for Education and Skills**, where she contributes to [**Education at a Glance**](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/serials/education-at-a-glance_g1gha6b0.html) and the [**UOE (UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat) data collection**](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=UNESCO_OECD_Eurostat_(UOE)_joint_data_collection_%E2%80%93_methodology). She focuses on **data-intensive work**, including data collection, cleaning, validation, and indicator construction. She develops and maintains analytical tools in **R** and **Stata** to ensure the quality, international comparability, and robustness of the data and indicator calculations. She leads the migration of indicator production processes from Stata do-files to R-based workflows. This includes developing internal **R packages** to ensure methodological consistency across indicators. Substantively, her work focuses on **teachers** and **disaggregated school- and institution-level data**. Additionally, she leads school data projects involving large administrative datasets and **geospatial analysis**.

Qi holds a **master's degree in economics (Analysis and Policy in Economics)** from the **Paris School of Economics**, from which she graduated with honors. For her master's thesis, titled "Resilience in the Face of Climate Variability", she analyzed the effects of climate shocks on household decision-making in Bangladesh using satellite data, spatial analysis, and econometric methods. She was awarded a French government Master’s scholarship during her studies.

Her research experience spans **climate and development economics**, **political economy**, and **urban and regional economics**. She has contributed to projects on environmental regulation in India that use machine learning methods applied to large-scale text data; fiscal transfers and population agglomeration in China; and the social integration of relocated populations based on original field surveys. Through these projects, she has developed expertise in **Stata**, **R**, **Python**, and **GIS tools**, such as **QGIS** and **ArcGIS**, as well as **survey design** and **field-based research**.
